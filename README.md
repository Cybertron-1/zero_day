# My Markdown Example

This is a simple example of Markdown text. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text in a simple and readable way.

## Headings

You can create headings using the hash symbol (#). The number of hash symbols determines the level of the heading. For example, "# Heading 1" represents a top-level heading, while "## Heading 2" represents a subheading.

## Lists

Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists. Here's an example of an unordered list:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

And here's an example of an ordered list:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Links

You can create links by enclosing the text in square brackets and the URL in parentheses. Here's an example: [OpenAI's website](https://openai.com).

## Emphasis

You can add emphasis to your text using asterisks or underscores. For example, you can make text *italic* or **bold**.

## Code Blocks

To display code or code snippets, you can use backticks. For inline code, use single backticks, like `print("Hello, World!")`. For multiline code blocks, use triple backticks:

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, World!")

greet()
